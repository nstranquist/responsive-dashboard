# Responsie Dashboard Layout
### Work in progress

## Goal:
Create a dashboard layout that can be scaled out to a full-featured dashboard. Built using nothing but html and css, from scratch.  

## Thoughts:
There's still a lot that needs to be done. A few on my list:  
- add svg icons  
- add better js animations  
- make more mobile-friendly  
- better color scheme  
- box-shadows / depth  
- actual functionality with javascript  
- etc etc etc...  
  
But I like the starting point!
